My input was "qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnmqwer" which is 30 characters equivalent to 30 bytes. Therefore, the input that I gave
must have been less than what was allocated for the process because I didn't get a segmentation fault, but at the same time
the input must have also been greater than the empty allocated space in the RAM for both the number and name variables because
the name variable overrid part of the number variable. Thus my input overrid some of the data in the number input variable
causing the calculations to be wrong.
